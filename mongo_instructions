If you're using Ubuntu/ Linux, run the following commands. First, mongodump on the origin server:

mongodump  --db newsgacdev

Copy the generated dump/DataBaseName folder to the new machine. Then, import using mongorestore:

mongorestore --db newsgacdev /path/to/DataBaseName 

Note that /path/to/DataBaseName should be a directory filled with .json and .bson representations of your data
